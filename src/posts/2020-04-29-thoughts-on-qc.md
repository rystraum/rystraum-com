It's about time that they should break up Quezon City into multiple cities.
It's just too big. It's at least 1/5 of the whole Metro Manila. 

The fact that it's too big is becoming obvious with how QC Government is handling the COVID-19 crisis. People aren't getting the support that they need in time because the government doesn't have enough people to give out said support.
